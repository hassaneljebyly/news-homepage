### What I learned

first time using Bootstrap after 2 years of using only vanilla css, It's easy to use if you know css already but with so much limitations

### Continued development

Although I prefer vanilla CSS Bootstrap is a great workflow, probably gonna rarely use it but I would love to get comfortable with it

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/) - only resource you need, the best documentation I have ever read.
